## Spectator Mode
To run spectator mode:
* Start the server in `99_genre_multiplayer/server`
* Open as many instances of the game as you want
* Press `O` on one game to start uploading its state to the server
 * This is the client that will play the game
* Press `I` on all of the other open instances to start downloading the state from ther server
 * These are the spectators

Spectator mode works best with less spectators. However, it supports any number of spectators.
